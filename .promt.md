# replit promt

Make me a web app for building objects auditors that helps track photo of repair or build progress of diferrent objects including location info in lat lng form e.g. 50.32233 ,30.23244 and custom comment field (filled as text field manually, empty by default) directly on photo just taken by camera as a top line or bottom line, and with ability to place and rotate/resize arrow sticker and/or circle sticker on the photo after it was taken. After all manipulations photo must be uploaded to the server and after successful uploading resulting image, cleare photo and sticker overlay and location data, but keep comment field for next photo and photo must be never stored to the user device gallery. We need to take photo in browser without saving it to gallery . So when user take a photo we must to geolocate current user position (and ideally vector of user camera direction to display in what side user was looking while taking a photo, but it's optional but not a must have feature). Enable API access for custom integrations



# 1st task kiro

Improve location display, show a map marker icon ic bottom left corner under the photo and camera stream on all states and views, and resolved lat lng with a h2 style font size. 



Improve comment handling, if comment is empty when sending a photo warn user about it and if user press ok, send empty comment if cancel allow him to fill the comment first.



on render also draw additional row with photo uploaded timestamp in internatioonal format appending h4 style font size rown under resulting image aligned to the right with black background and white font color
