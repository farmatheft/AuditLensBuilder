Make me a web app for building objects auditors that helps track photo of repair or build progress of diferrent objects including location info in lat lng form e.g. 50.32233 ,30.23244 and custom comment field (filled as text field manually, empty by default) directly on photo just taken by camera as a top line or bottom line, and with ability to place and rotate/resize arrow sticker and/or circle sticker on the photo after it was taken. After all manipulations photo must be uploaded to the server and after successful uploading resulting image, cleare photo and sticker overlay and location data, but keep comment field for next photo and photo must be never stored to the user device gallery. We need to take photo in browser without saving it to gallery . So when user take a photo we must to geolocate current user position (and ideally vector of user camera direction to display in what side user was looking while taking a photo, but it's optional but not a must have feature).
